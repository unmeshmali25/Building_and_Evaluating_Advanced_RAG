# Building_and_Evaluating_Advanced_RAG
The repository uses llamaindex to build 3 levels of RAG applications on my personal blog. It also uses TrueEra to evaluate each of the RAG methodologies based on context relevance, answer relevance, and groundedness

IMP : This is a follow-along from Deeplearning.AI's short course. But I am using my own keys and data to expand on the implementation.
